## Overview of Statistical Analysis
#### Is a Bike Sharing Operation possible in Des Moines?
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data from NYC Citi Bike and create visualizations that provide insight on the demographics of the user base, the most popular timeframes to use a bike share service, and other information including where are the hotspots for bike share locations in the city.  This information is all vital in determining a proper business plan for Des Moines, Iowa if the city chooses to move forward with a bike sharing program.  Obviously Des Moines is not New York, but these visualizations can help potential investors identify the key driving factors that influence bike share programs.

## Summary

These results show that CitiBike is a highly popular service among males, with male subscribers being the primary consumer user of the service.  Female subscribers are also a consistent revenue source with females making up 25% of the user base.  Both male and female customers make contribute very little to the trip volume.  Two more possible visualizations would be a distribution of the age of users, and this same visualization but filtered by gender.  One last visualization idea would be a map of starting locations by volume and filtered by gender.  This could help to understand why there are less females taking part in the service.
